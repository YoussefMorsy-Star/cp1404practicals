# Practical 02
What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?
100% I’ve watched the key parts that helped me complete the practicals, but I’m still catching up on the rest.

What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?
I usually watch them at home in the evenings. I try to set aside an hour or so a few nights a week now to catch up and stay on track.

What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?
When I sit down to work on a prac, I really focus and make sure I understand the code properly instead of rushing through it. I also commit my work properly now and push it to GitHub.

What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?
I definitely need to stop putting things off.

What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?
I didn’t follow up consistently each week, and I let things pile up. I want to change that by starting each prac early and asking for help straight away if I get stuck.

What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?
I’m putting in more effort now to refactor code properly and understand how functions work. I’ve also started using Git and GitHub properly which is helping me stay organised.
